# Sample Code Refractor Project for a Fictional Digital Marketing Agency

## Description 

Front-end web developers are often contracted to take existing code and refactor it to keep up with changing technologies and standards.  A key component of this type of project is to follow a "golden rule", often referred to as the "Scout Rule":  Always leave the code you are editing a little bit cleaner than your found it.

In this project we have completed a clean up of the fictional Digital Marketing Company's HTML code.  We have not changed anything about the website, rather we have taken generic div elements, changed them to much more descriptive elements when possible, and organized them into a logical structure.  We have reduced the number of classes assigned to the various div elements and we have consolidated and cleaned up the CSS selectors and properties.  As a result, repetitive HTML elements with the same styling are now organized into groups.

In addition, we have left comments above each change that was made to explain to the "next developer" what we have done and why.

We have also optimized the website's title for increased Search Engine Optimization.

Perhaps most importantly, we have updated the files to include alt identifiers that will make our fictional client's website compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act, and help them to avoid litigation.


## Installation

Installing this project would be as simple as replacing the HTML and CSS files on the website's server.
